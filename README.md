# BornHack 2022 Game On Badge add-on template

This project is a simple template, that can be used as a base for your own design. There are a series of prototyping holes covering the board, but simply removing those will give you plenty space for many projects.

The mounting holes will provide VCC (3.3v) and GND from the badge, and there is also a Qwiic/StemmaQT connector for an I2C connection to the badge via a cable.
